Modern cities suffer not from a lack of resources, but from a lack of coordination. Governments have become slow, opaque, and tangled in regulations that hinder local efficiency. Donors, coalitions, and volunteers mean well, but fragmentation between these entities results in time-consuming efforts to be duplicated.

ForkTheCity is a platform for communities to create and discover a civic networking platform for *their* needs from our open-source infrastructure and resources. It’s designed to make local problem-solving direct, transparent, and community owned. Our goal is to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy by empowering neighborhoods to organize, fund, and execute civic work with modular and scalable tools.

In other words, instead of waiting for governments to act, ForkTheCity provides the digital infrastructure for communities to “fork the system”.

As an **infrastructure maintainer**, there are several projects you could contribute to:

- **Microsite Template:** The civic network platform, one for each city/community, where residents can track issues & civic projects, coordinate volunteers, and manage direct funding. Existing local non-profits and coalitions can also use the microsite as a platform for recruitment and visibility.  
- **Microsite Infrastructure:** Building comprehensive deployment guides and security hardening resources for community forkers making their own instances. This is essentially a cybersecurity role, which includes protection against common attack vectors(DDoS mitigation, input sanitization, assuring authentication best practices),  encryption standards for data at test and in transit automated backup configuration, and disaster recovery protocols to keep our network safe and ensure data integrity\!   
- **Landing Page:** This is the gateway for users to discover ForkTheCity, and how to fork a microsite for their community. If a microsite is created, it will be added to the directory in the Landing Page. That way, when someone tries to create another microsite for the same city, it’ll instead display the existing microsite. We can also use this to recruit more maintainers, policy advocates, artists, and engineers.

As part of the **infrastructure team**, you could:

- Handle deployment tooling such as CI/CD pipelines and build scripts.  
- Maintain testing environments for both the landing page and the microsite template.  
- Oversee uptime monitoring and backups.

As a **policy advocate**, you could:

- Identify and map local or federal regulations that obstruct civic innovation (e.g., zoning, permitting, or data transparency laws)  
- Create educational materials that help volunteers understand how to navigate and challenge bureaucratic systems effectively.  
- Build partnerships between local governments and ForkTheCity communities to streamline local ForkTheCity initiatives.  
- Use data gathered from ForkTheCity instances to demonstrate the impact of local collaboration and push for systemic reform.

As part of the **design \+ UX team**, you could:

- Define the visual language of ForkTheCity, including color palettes, icons, and typography, and provide customization options for microsites. These assets would also be used by the outreach team.  
- Produce wireframes and component libraries for the maintainers.  
- Collaborate on “gamified” features such as “local team badges”.  
- Ensure the UI stays accessible on mobile and low-bandwidth devices.

As part of the **outreach team**, you could:

- Recruit contributors, maintain the Discord, and host onboarding calls.  
- Manage social media and educational explainers.  
- Help new forks grow their local network.  
- Collect and share success stories from local instances.  
- Organize hackathons and “Civic Prototype Challenges” to prototype new features from the open-source **R\&D engineering team** in public, promoting engagement and STEM education.

As part of the **Research & Development** **(R\&D) engineering team**, you could:

- Identify, prototype, and document low-cost technologies that improve livability, walkability, and sustainability.  
- Develop build guides and cost breakdowns for volunteers (e.g. cool pavements, piezoelectric sidewalks or lighting, smart benches).  
- Publish findings in an accessible way.  
- Collaborate with engineers and urban designers to validate ideas through small pilots.  
- Maintain partnerships with universities, labs, or makerspaces interested in field testing.

Important Notes:  
**Data Ownership and Privacy:**

- All data generated by a microsite belongs to that community and its contributors.  
- We never store user identities from microsites.  
- Local contributors can remain pseudonymous unless local verification is required for safety. (e.g., paid work or certifications)  
- Local contributors can delete their data at any time; forks must comply immediately.

**Liability & Local Responsibilities**

- ForkTheCity as a project provides infrastructure and documentation, not operational authority.  
- Communities are responsible for ensuring their actions comply with local laws. However, advocating for code reform and updates is permitted and encouraged under free speech.  
- Contributors acknowledge that civic work carries inherent risks; each fork is encouraged to register as a nonprofit, cooperative, or volunteer group when feasible.  
- Maintainers and developers of the microsite templates and the landing page are not legally liable for misuse of the platform.  
- Residency Verification: optional but recommended; proof of address or community affiliation handled locally (e.g., community endorsement, student ID, or utility token).

**Ethical Use Standards**

- Every fork must publish how decisions are made and who holds technical control.  
- No unpaid labor may be disguised as “volunteering” for profit-making entities.
